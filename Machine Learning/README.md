ecommerce analysis notebook file summary:

In this report, we explored the application of machine learning techniques to categorize and forecast the income of customers for a hypothetical eCommerce company. Emphasis was placed on regression, a subset of supervised learning, leveraging it to anticipate income based on parameters like age, website activity, and employment sector. Among the various regression algorithms tested, the Kernel Ridge Laplacian surfaced as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of approximately 78%. For further analysis, we partitioned our dataset into two categories: users earning above $35k and those earning below this threshold. We engaged both traditional classification algorithms and a neural network for comparison. Notably, the decision tree algorithm, boasting a 94% accuracy, not only outshone other conventional algorithms but also eclipsed our neural network's performance. This underscores the notion that while neural networks are powerful, certain tasks, as evidenced in our study, may be more adeptly executed using traditional algorithms.
